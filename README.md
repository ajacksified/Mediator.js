A light utility class to help implement the Mediator pattern for easy eventing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mediator is a simple class that allows you to register, unregister, and call
subscriber methods to help event-based, asyncronous programming.  Its purpose
is to make the usage of WebSockets, Ajax calls, DOM events, or any other
asynchronous operations easy to maintain and test.

Mediator has no dependencies on any other libraries.

Why?
---
My specific use case: bind elements easily for WebSocket callbacks. But, you
may find usage in it for all kinds of things: as an event management system,
to decouple calls between javascript functions, Ajax request callbacks, and
more. There's an excellent online book that talks about Mediators more in detail
by [Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#mediatorpatternjavascript).

Usage
-----

### Using in Node

The package is in NPM as `mediator-js`. Include it in your project like so:

```javascript
var Mediator = require("mediator-js").Mediator,
    mediator = new Mediator();

mediator.subscribe("wat", function(){ console.log(arguments); });
mediator.publish("wat", 7, "hi", { one: 1 });
```

### Using in the Browser

Mediator.js is compatible with browser module-loading solutions, including but
not limited to Browserify, Almond.js, Require.js, and others.

__Note__: if using AMD / Almond module loading, use the NPM package name:
`require("mediator-js").Mediator`

```html
<script src="/js/Mediator.min.js"></script>

<script>
  var Mediator = require("mediator-js").Mediator,
      mediator = new Mediator();

  mediator.subscribe("wat", function(){ console.log(arguments); });
  mediator.publish("wat", 7, "hi", { one: 1 });
</script>
```

### API

You can register events with the mediator two ways using channels. You can add
a predicate to perform more complex matching.  Instantiate a new mediator, and
then you can being subscribing, removing, and publishing.

To use it in the browser, include `mediator.min.js` from the root here, or the
unminified version at `lib/mediator.js.`

Subscription signature:
    var mediator = new Mediator();

    mediator.subscribe(channel, callback, <options>, <context>);
    mediator.publish(channel, <data, data, ... >)
    mediator.remove(channel, <identifier>)

Additionally, `on` and `bind` are aliased to `subscribe`, and `trigger` and
`emit` are bound to `publish`. `off` is an alias for `remove`. You can use
`once` to subscribe to an event that should only be fired once.

Subscriber signature:

    function(<data, data ...>, channel);

The channel is always returned as the last argument to subscriber functions.

Mediator.subscribe options (all are optional; default is empty):

```javascript
{
  predicate: function(*args){ ... }
  priority: 0|1|... 
  calls: 1|2|...
}
```

Predicates return a boolean and are run using whatever args are passed in by the
publishing class. If the boolean is true, the subscriber is run.

Priority marks the order in which a subscriber is called.

`calls` allows you to specify how many times the subscriber is called before it
is automatically removed. This is decremented each time it is called until it
reaches 0 and is removed. If it has a predicate and the predicate does not match,
calls is not decremented.

A Subscriber object is returned when calling Mediator.subscribe. It allows you
to update options on a given subscriber, or to reference it by an id for easy
removal later.

```javascript
{
  id, // guid
  fn, // function
  options, // options
  context, // context for fn to be called within
  channel, // provides a pointer back to its channel
  update(options){ ...} // update the subscriber ({ fn, options, context })
}
```

Examples:

```javascript
var mediator = new Mediator();

// Alert data when the "message" channel is published to
// Subscribe returns a "Subscriber" object
mediator.subscribe("message", function(data){ alert(data); });
mediator.publish("message", "Hello, world");

// Alert the "message" property of the object called when the predicate function returns true (The "From" property is equal to "Jack")
var predicate = function(data){ return data.From === "Jack" };
mediator.subscribe("channel", function(data){ alert(data.Message); }, { predicate: predicate });
mediator.publish("channel", { Message: "Hey!", From: "Jack" }); //alerts
mediator.publish("channel", { Message: "Hey!", From: "Audrey" }); //doesn't alert

//You can pass "context" argument as third parameter of if "options" doesn't defined
var listener = {
    text: 'Event has been published',
    onEvent: function() {
        alert(this.text);
    }
}
mediator.subscribe("channel", listener.onEvent, listener);
mediator.subscribe("channel", listener.onEvent, {calls: 1}, listener);
mediator.publish("channel"); //we'll have two alerts
mediator.publish("channel"); //we'll have an one alert because the second subscriber does have a "calls:1" option
```

You can remove events by passing in a channel, or a channel and the
function to remove or subscriber id. If you only pass in a channel,
all subscribers are removed.

```javascript
// removes all methods bound directly to a channel, but not subchannels
mediator.remove("channel");

// unregisters *only* MethodFN, a named function, from "channel"
mediator.remove("channel", MethodFN);
```

You can call the registered functions with the Publish method, which accepts 
an args array:

```javascript
mediator.publish("channel", "argument", "another one", { etc: true });
```

You can namespace your subscribing / removing / publishing as such:

```javascript
mediator.subscribe("application:chat:receiveMessage", function(data){ ... });

// will call parents of the application:chat:receiveMessage namespace
// (that is, next it will call all subscribers of application:chat, and then
// application). It will not recursively call subchannels - only direct subscribers.
mediator.publish("application:chat:receiveMessage", "Jack Lawson", "Hey");
```

You can update Subscriber priority:

```javascript
var sub = mediator.subscribe("application:chat", function(data){ ... });
var sub2 = mediator.subscribe("application:chat", function(data){ ... });

// have sub2 executed first
mediator.getChannel("application:chat").setPriority(sub2.id, 0);
```

You can update Subscriber callback, context, and/or options:

```javascript
sub.update({ fn: ..., context: { }, options: { ... });
```

You can stop the chain of execution by calling channel.stopPropagation():

```javascript
// for example, let's not post the message if the from and to are the same
mediator.subscribe("application:chat", function(data, channel){
  alert("Don't send messages to yourself!");
  channel.stopPropagation();
}, options: {
  predicate: function(data){ return data.From == data.To },
  priority: 0
});
```
