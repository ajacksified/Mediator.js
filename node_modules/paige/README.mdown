### Paige.js - *Painless page generation for Github code*

Paige.js is a simple npm package for creating instant [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) without having to deal with any HTML *or* CSS coding. Paige let's you just focus on your code while providing a clean and presentable face for your project. The project page for Paige, itself, was generated with paige.js.

Paige is largely influenced by [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/) and [Underscore](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/). The idea behind this project was to&mdash;in a sense&mdash;extend the wonderful functionality of Docco, and take it one step further as a more fully-featured project site. As such, Paige uses Docco for its source-file annotation, and its style is inspired heavily on the beauty and simplicity of the Underscore website. Not only that, but they are both direct dependencies of this project as well.

Paige.js is [hosted on Github](https://github.com/rthauby/Paige). Please feel free to mess around with it and let me know of any bugs you find. Also you can always reach me on twitter [@rthauby](http://www.twitter.com/rthauby).

### Demo

You're either reading this at the [project page itself](http://rthauby.github.com/Paige/), or on the Github repo site. If it's the latter, you can see the output of running paige against this very Readme file [here](http://rthauby.github.com/Paige/). If it's the former, well, you're looking at it.

### Installation Instructions

You'll be needing [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/) and [Underscore](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/). Then to install:

`` sudo npm install paige ``

... then you can just do:

`` paige path/to/config ``

... and go have a beer or two.

### Configuration

Paige takes one argument only, and it's the location to a configuration file. Alternatively you can just skip the location of this file, and Paige will default to *paige.config* at the root of your project. The configuration file must be in JSON format.

A basic configuration file looks like this:

     {
        "title" :             "Paige.js",
        "content_file" :      "README.mdown",
        "include_index" :     true,
        "docco_files" :       "src/*.coffee",
        "header" :            "Paige.js",
        "subheader" :         "The quickie-wiki Github project page generator",
        "background" :        "bright_squares"
        }

The properties here are:

- *title*: Title for the page... As in, in the `<head>` tag
- *content_file*: path to the file were your project page main content resides.
- *include_index*: Do you want to list out the project files a-la-docco?
- *docco_files*: If so, where are they?
- *header*: Main header for the page.
- *subheader*: Your tagline goes here.
- *background*: Eye candy. Available flavors are: bright-squares, felt, whitey, diagonal-noise, circles, project-paper. All pattern sourced from the brilliant [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/)

### Known Issues

- Docco file generation supported only on unix-based system.
- Index of files is not ordered alphabetically.
